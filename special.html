			<h2> Into the Deep </h2>
			<p> With new discoveries every trip to the deep sea, we continue to uncover more of what it has hidden from us. Its dark void is enough to hold mysteries that can last for centuries and the Web Aquarium has joined the rest of the marine
				biologists to cover as much ground as we can. For this month, we have uncovered the "deep web" from a sea creature called a Siphonophore. It is not a singular animal but a colony of tiny animals forming as long as the giant squid. It roams as
				a drifter, collecting sea snow as its diet.</p>
